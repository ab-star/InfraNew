										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a precast solutions provider, an <a href="/accreditations/">Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)</a> is vital as it transparently communicates the environmental impact of products, aiding in sustainable material choices. It enhances credibility, supports certifications, and aligns with industry sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Fuji Silvertech is excited to share its latest milestone â€” an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) grant for our Precast solutions. Aligned with the UN&#8217;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), this EPD, independently verified by EPDHub, underscores our commitment to sustainable consumption and combating climate change. EPDs enable transparent comparison of construction materials, crucial for certifications like LEED and BREEAM.</p>
<p><a href="https://fujisilvertech.com/">Fuji Silvertech</a>, a leading precast solutions provider in India, is taking pioneering steps in the precast manufacturing industry to champion environmentally conscious and innovative practices. Committed to achieving industrial sustainability and contributing to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the company focuses on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12 and 13, which aim to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns and urgently address climate change impacts. A noteworthy development was the acquisition of the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) certificate for its Precast T25 Drains and Utility Ducts. This achievement is based on a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment Study conducted for these products, meticulously following the standards set for EPD preparation and published through the EPD Program Operator EPDHub (EPD No. HUB-0843).</p>
<p>Fuji Silvertech&#8217;s EPD for Precast T25 <a href="/u-shape-drains/">Drains and utility ducts</a> conforms to ISO 14025, ISO 21930 and EN 15804 and is independently and externally verified through EPDHub. EPDs, by design, foster environmentally conscious decision-making and instil a life cycle perspective within industries. By making transparent data easily accessible, they drive positive change throughout the manufacturing and supply chain, enhancing credibility and sustainability in the broader construction industry.</p>
<p>FUJI Silvertech is unwavering in its commitment to subject every precast product to a thorough carbon footprint and cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. This evaluation covers core environmental impacts such as Global Warming Potential, ozone layer depletion, acidification potential, eutrophication, tropospheric ozone formation potential, abiotic depletion potential, and water use. The company has undertaken environmental labelling and declaration by ISO 14025:2006 and has set a benchmark for sustainability in building and civil engineering works through ISO 21930:2017, emerging as the first precast industry in India to publish an externally verified EPD for its Precast T25 Drains and utility ducts. The FUJI Silvertech Environmental Product Declaration adheres to the international standard for EPDs (ISO 14025) and follows the Product Category Rule (PCR). The EPD has a comprehensive &#8220;Cradle to Gate&#8221; scope, encompassing production to dispatch stages with modules C1-C4, D. It includes ecological data related to raw material production, inbound transportation, and manufacturing, assessed based on an average one-tonne precast product. The EPD is now publicly available on EPD-Hub (epdhub.com).</p>
