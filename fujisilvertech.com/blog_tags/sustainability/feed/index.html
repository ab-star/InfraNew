										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>  in precast concrete industry can be driven by many factors. <a href="https://fujisilvertech.com/">FUJI Silvertech</a> Concrete Pvt. Ltd., India’s largest precast concrete manufacturers of the time provides precast solutions pan-India examines the key drivers that propel the sustainability efforts in the organization.</p>
<p>Indian government authorities like <strong>The Ministry of <a href="/roads-and-bridges/"> Road Transport and Highways,</a> The Ministry of housing and urban affairs</strong> and <strong>the Ministry of railways</strong> have promoted sustainable technologies like precast concrete construction in their many circulars and communications. FUJI Silvertech pioneers in the precast concrete solutions provider and firmly believes that the technology is the game changer for Indian infrastructure in terms of <strong>growth, speed and excellence.</strong></p>
<p>FUJI Silvertech <strong>leadership vision</strong> of sustainable management and manufacturing practices, as demonstrated by the organisational <strong>commitment to Indian, Japanese and International standards, </strong>abidance of more than <strong>50 legal and statutory norms,</strong> the stand on <strong> environmental protection</strong> and <strong>safe and healthy work culture</strong> are inherent and addictive factors that drive the fabric of the organization. The commitment is demonstrated by the policies and awareness of these policies among all persons working in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational culture and values</strong> are at the core of sustainable efforts put forth by FUJI Silvertech. The infrastructure as noticed by green cover, clean and hygienic <a href="/water-and-sewage/">water and sanitation facilities,</a> cleanliness, or the behaviour of the persons with respect to work is a predicament to the culture of the organization towards sustainability. <strong>Human values</strong> towards <strong>environment,</strong> towards <strong>discipline and quality</strong> and in the sincerity of performing <strong>process operations</strong> are the strength on which the <strong>organization processes</strong> become <strong>sustainable.</strong></p>
<p>FUJI Silvertech’s <strong>factory internal standards,</strong> an amalgamation of Japanese culture and <strong>Indian perseverance</strong> are symbolic of <strong>industrial operations</strong> which by far are unmatched in performance or efficiency. FUJI Silvertech’s integrated management system standards consisting of <strong>ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018, ISO 17025:2005</strong> through its process of documentation, measurement and monitoring, internal and external auditing and performance reviews naturally keep a system up and fine. In a way these certifications demonstrate the efforts of FUJI Silvertech in terms of <strong>quality, environmental, occupational health and safety management; the three major pillars of sustainability.</strong></p>
<p>FUJI Silvertech has not only demonstrated their capabilities as a  <strong>reliable supplier</strong> of precast solutions but has also demonstrated its <strong>customer connect</strong> through participation in the chain of custody through <strong>supplier sustainability assessments (SSA)</strong> and <strong>social accountability assessments (SA8000)</strong> thus supporting their large clients in their <strong>business responsibility and sustainability reporting (BRSR)</strong> processes. FUJI Silvertech has joined the India drive of <strong>quality and sustainability</strong> urged by the honourable <strong>PM Shri Narendra Modi</strong> and demonstrated their sustainability practices through its <a href="/accreditations/">zero effect zero defect (ZED) certification.</a></p>
<p><strong>Employee education and motivation is identified as a natural and key driver as it is in the persona of every human being trying to make the world a more sustainable place. These needs have been initiated and fired by employee education, awareness programs and trainings such as tool box talks on safety culture, training on responsible and sustainable procurement, code of conduct etc.</strong></p>
<p>FUJI Silvertech has gone an additional mile in sustainability when it comes to precast solutions. Every precast product at FUJI Silvertech is planned to undergo <strong>carbon footprint and cradle to gate life cycle assessment for core environmental impacts</strong> like Global warming potential (total, fossil &#038; biogenic, LULUC), depletion potential of ozone layer, acidification potential, eutrophication aquatic freshwater, marine, terrestrial), formation potential of tropospheric ozone, abiotic depletion potential (fossil &#038; non fossil) and water use deprived. Fuji Silvertech will soon perform <strong>environmental labelling and declaration</strong> as per <strong> ISO 14025: 2006 and benchmark sustainability in building and civil engineering</strong> works through <strong>ISO 21930: 2017</strong> and be a testament of <strong>sustainability in construction works as per EN 15804:2012.</strong></p>
<p>FUJI Silvertech precast concrete stands as a testimony of <strong>sustainable construction and life cycle perspective thinking.</strong></p>
